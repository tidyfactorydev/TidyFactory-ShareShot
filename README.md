### 📸 Capture
- **GIF FPS** *(8–60, default: 12)*  
  Frames per second for capture. Higher values = smoother animation but larger file size.
- **Max Record Length (BufferSeconds)** *(1–60s, default: 16)*  
  Maximum recording duration. Recording stops automatically at this limit.
- **Max Palette Size** *(default: 256)*  
  Maximum number of colors in the GIF palette. Lower values reduce file size but may lower quality.
- **Dither** *(default: true)*  
  Apply dithering when reducing colors. Helps preserve detail but may introduce noise.

### 🖼 Output
- **Include UI** *(default: false)*  
  Include Slate/HUD UI elements in the capture. If disabled, only the scene render is recorded.
- **GIF Width / Height** *(16–1280, default: 480x480)*  
  Output resolution of the GIF. Cannot exceed viewport size.
- **Save Directory** *(default: `<Project>/Saved/ShareShot`)*  
  Directory where GIFs are saved.  
  - A subfolder with the current date (YYYYMMDD) is created automatically.  
  - Example: `<Project>/Saved/ShareShot/20250901/ShareShot_20250901_145607.gif`
